Supporting data for Marcilio-Silva et al. 2025
Summary of the Bayesian multilevel models showing the effects of patch size, patch area/perimeter ratio, urbanization score, distance to the nearest patch, jurisdictional agency types (01 for federal, 02 for state, 03 county, 04 cross-county, 05 city, and 06 for others), distance to the patch edge, and distance to the nearest paved trail on multilevel models of forest patch diversity, structure, and complexity across the Anoka Sandplain, Big Woods, and St. Paul - Baldwin ecological subsections. The abbreviations represent Marginal R2 (Marg. R2), Conditional R2 (Cond. R2), standard error of the estimate (Est. Error), lower (l-95% CI) and upper (u-95% CI) bounds of the 95% credible interval for the estimate, model convergence diagnostic (Rhat),  effective sample size for bulk estimates (Bulk ESS), and Effective sample size for the distribution tails (Tail ESS). For detailed descriptions of predictors, see the Methods section.
